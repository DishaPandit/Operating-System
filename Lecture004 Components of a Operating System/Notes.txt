-> What is Spooling in OS? The expansion of spooling is simultaneous peripheral operations online.
 Simultaneous means for example if two or more users issue the print command, and the printer can 
 accept the requests even the printer printing some other jobs. The printer printing one job, 
 at the same time the " Spool Disk " can load some other jobs.

1. Nano kernal - It is the type of kernel that offers hardware abstraction but without system services. 
Micro Kernel also does not have system services therefore the Micro Kernel and Nano Kernel have become analogous. ex. -EROS etc.
Advantage - It offers hardware abstractions without system services
Disadvantage - It is quite same as Micro kernel hence it is less used.

2. Exo kernal - It is the type of kernel which follows end-to-end principle. 
It has fewest hardware abstractions as possible. 
It allocates physical resources to applications. ex- Nemesis, ExOS etc.
Advantage - It has fewest hardware abstractions.
Disadvantage - There is more work for application developers.
