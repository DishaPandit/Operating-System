--> Concurrency -  It is the ability to execute multiple instructions at same time.

--> How to achieve concurrency - We divide process into multiple threads which processes different instruction of the same process.

--> Thread - Independent sub task of a process. Can be advantageous when we have >1 CPU. 
It is done to achieve parallelism in the process. Ex. typing and doing spell check in MS Word simultaneously.

--> Every thread has its TCB(Thread control block) just like PCB.

--> Benefits of multithreading

1. Responsiveness increases becoz several independent works are going on simultaneously
2. Resource sharing - address of a particular process in shared among threads
3. More economical - context switching between threads is fast
4. Threads utilized multi core CPUs in a better way
